webcomponents.js
================

A suite of polyfills supporting the HTML web components specs:

**Custom Elements**: allows authors to define their own custom tags ([spec](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/)).

**HTML Imports**: a way to include and reuse HTML documents via other HTML documents ([spec](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/)).

**Shadow DOM**: provides encapsulation by hiding DOM subtrees under shadow roots ([spec](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/)).

This also folds in polyfills for `MutationObserver` and `WeakMap`.


## Builds

`webcomponents.js` includes all of the polyfills.

`webcomponents-lite.js` includes all polyfills except for shadow DOM.
